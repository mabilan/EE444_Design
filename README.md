EE 444 Design Project - Temp. Sensor Reporting to NFC Tag

## Project Members
Michael Bilan and Kyle Tam

## Project Overview
This design project is design to do the following:
* Sample the on-board temperature sensor at a rate of 1 sample/second
* Store sampled data locally on the device until requested by NFC tag
* Transmit stored data to NFC tag via I2C (for device use)

This functionality will server as a proof-of-concept for an expanded Wearable RF Meter project.
